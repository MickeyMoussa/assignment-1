# AI Usage
## Debugging
I had issues with blocks collapsing on each other, ChatGPT pointed out that that can be caused by nesting boxmodels inside each other by not terminating tags properly
## JS
Generated code for the greeting message that dynamically changes depending on the time of day
##Comments
Generated comments for my work help document context and logic behind my framework
## Benefits
1. Helped me debug the collapse problem efficiently. Since it was a very contextualized issue, Googling an answer would be difficult
2. Made me understand how to prevent it next time by making sure to terminate tags properly
3. 
## Learning outcomes
1. Learnt how to make myself more presentable on the web using HTML, CSS, JS, and integrating AI tools in the process
## Prompt Engineering
Since HTML is an inherently formatting-based language, personal judgement and taste plays a big factor. If ChatGPT gave me a response that was functional but in the format I prefer, I refer to the same code but with slight adjustments to make it closer to what I originally wanted in my token request
