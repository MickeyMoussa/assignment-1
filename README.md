# assignment-1
In this portfolio. I emphasized using the latest tools taught in class, particularly the boxmodel and flex. 
## how to run
this is a fairly rudimentary program. You can run this by downloading or forking this repo, then running the index.html file with a local browser. 
## Boxmodel
I used to the boxmodel to segment my page into box segments for the About Me, Projects, and More Info. sections. 
## Flex
This was used to list photos of the projects in a neat way that supports wrappers since the images may be too large to fit in one row.
## Flex Shrink
Although I used the flex: xyz shortcut for this, I made sure the y value that corresponds to the flex-shrink component is activated so flex items can shrink to be aesthetically pleasing when thw window is resized.
## CSS
I used a gif as a background img to achieve a dark-blue retro aesthetic that I find attrative. Additionally, I adjusted the link state colors since blue links with a dark blue background doesn't match.
##JS
JS was used to write a greeting message that depending on the time of day changed the message.
